## sql query for how to insert a user in user table with username,email,password, roles that has many to many relation with role table

To insert a user into a user table with username, email, password, and roles that has a many-to-many relationship with a role table, you'll typically follow these steps. First, you would insert the user into the user table and then associate them with the appropriate roles in the join table. Assuming you have the following tables:

1. `user` table with columns `id`, `username`, `email`, and `password`.
2. `role` table with columns `id` and `name`.
3. `user_role` table (the join table) with columns `user_id` and `role_id`.

Here's an example SQL query:

```sql
-- Insert the role into the roles table
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_USER');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_ADMIN');


-- Insert the user into the user table
INSERT INTO user (username, email, password)
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'hashed_password');

-- Get the user's ID
SELECT @user_id := LAST_INSERT_ID();

-- Insert the user's roles into the user_role table
INSERT INTO user_role (user_id, role_id)
VALUES (@user_id, (SELECT id FROM role WHERE name = 'ROLE_USER')),
       (@user_id, (SELECT id FROM role WHERE name = 'ROLE_ADMIN'));
```

In this query:

- First, you insert the user into the `user` table with the username, email, and password.
- You retrieve the user's ID using `LAST_INSERT_ID()`.
- Then, you insert the user's roles into the `user_role` table, associating the user with the roles. In this example, we're assuming the roles are 'ROLE_USER' and 'ROLE_ADMIN', but you can adapt this to your specific roles.

Please note that you should securely hash the password before inserting it into the database. The above query provides a basic example of how to insert a user with roles in a many-to-many relationship. The actual SQL syntax may vary based on your database system, and in a real application, you would typically use prepared statements or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework to interact with the database.
